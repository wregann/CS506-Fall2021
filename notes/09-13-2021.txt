Going through using github
Looking at commits for a repository, each commit has a unique ID, showed it on github
and then on a local repository (git log)

git status showed if files were changed, used git add eg_file.txt to add to be pushed to
github

git commit -m "Message" adds the commit to your local git repo

git push origin master - pushes it to github

git rebase -i commit_id

If you try to just push to github it will get an error, so have to used the -f flag
git push origin master -f 

Changed git repo on github

git fetch origin to fetch the changes

git status show that the git repo on github was changed

git rebase origin/master (instead of git pull, since git pull can cause conflicts when
the files are pulled)

Spoke about pull request that attempts to change files that have to be approved before
being commited to the main repo

Spoke about forking on github which creates a copy of the repo

Showed how to do a fork and then rebase it to become updated with the master branch

git checkout -b branchname (to create a branch)	

git log

Spoke about debugging

Adding structure to your code

Types of methods
	-Top down approach (writing pseudocode of your general solution
	-Bottom up approach
	-Solve the problem first - then improve/refine

General:
	-Boring code is good code: keep it simple
	-don't commit to specificity, try and solve the general problem	
	-functions with small bodies > one function with large body
	-read code before testing
